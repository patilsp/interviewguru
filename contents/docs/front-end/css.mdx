# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web pages, allowing for the separation of content and design.

## What is CSS?

CSS is a language that defines how HTML elements should be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. It provides the ability to apply styles to multiple web pages, ensuring a consistent look and feel across a website.

## Key Points

2. **Selectors**: CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles based on their attributes, classes, IDs, and more.
3. **Box Model**: CSS defines the box model, which includes margins, borders, padding, and the content area, to control the spacing and layout of elements.
4. **Responsive Design**: CSS includes features like media queries that enable the creation of responsive designs, ensuring web pages look good on various devices and screen sizes.
5. **Animations and Transitions**: CSS provides properties for creating animations and transitions, adding dynamic and interactive effects to web pages.
